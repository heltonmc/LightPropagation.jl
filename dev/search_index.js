The thickness, refractive index, reduced scattering and absorption coefficients of layer k are denoted by l_k n_k mu_s_k mu_a_k, respectively. The extrapolated boundary condition is used with the extrapolation length z_b_k = 2 A_k D_k where A_k reflection factor calculated from the angle-averaged probability for reflection at a boundary between layer k and the surrounding medium.

More interestingly, s_n are the roots of J_m satisfying J_m(a s_n) = 0qquad n = 1 2 . For an incident source on the center top, the summation over all orders of J_m is no longer needed so we only need to consider m=0. s_n then becomes the roots to Bessel function of the first kind and zero order. It should be noted that both J_0 and J_1 appear in the solution but this is because the general solution is in the form of J_m and J_m+1. For those familiar with the trickier case presented in [3] and then extended in [4] and [5] this is main contribution to the accuracy, stability, and speed of the solutions. For those unfamilar, the decisive point is the numerically correct and efficient 2-D inverse Fourier transform of Phi(z s) must be calculated to obtain the fluence in real space Phi(vecr) (directly taking language from Liemert here). I would say this is most easily implemented by taking advantage of rotational symmetry and using the 1-D inverse Hankel Transform. In contrast, the nodes of the integral are not fixed like in the cylindrical case presented here, but is solved by adaptive Gauss integration. If the nodes were consistent, they could be precomputed and used for each case but the amount of nodes and their location depend on the forward parameters in the model. All this to say, precalculating the roots and storing them is highly efficient and significantly more accurate and stable. The roots are divided by a for each new condition.","category":"page"},{"location":"Nlayer_cyl/#Green's-function","page":"N-layer Cylinder","title":"Green's function","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"Nlayer_cyl/","page":"N-layer Cylinder","title":"N-layer Cylinder","text":"Finally, the Green's function in the first layer G_1(s_n z) is:","category":"page"},{"location":"Nlayer_cyl/","page":"N-layer Cylinder","title":"N-layer Cylinder","text":"G_1(s_n z) = frace^-alpha_1 z - z_0 - e^-alpha_1 (z + z_0 + 2z_b_1)2D_1 alpha_1 + fracsinhalpha_1(z_0 + z_b_1) sinhalpha_1(z + z_b_1)D_1alpha_1 e^alpha_1(l_1 + z_b_1) 5pt\ntimes fracD_1alpha_1n_1^2beta_3 - D_2alpha_2n_2^2gamma_3D_1alpha_1n_1^2beta_3coshalpha_1(l_1 + z_b_1) + D_2alpha_2n_2^2gamma_3sinhalpha_1(l_1 + z_b_1)","category":"page"},{"location":"Nlayer_cyl/","page":"N-layer Cylinder","title":"N-layer Cylinder","text":"Where alpha_k has the form in the steady-state:","category":"page"},{"location":"Nlayer_cyl/","page":"N-layer Cylinder","title":"N-layer Cylinder","text":"alpha_k = sqrts_n^2 + fracmu_a_kD","category":"page"},{"location":"Nlayer_cyl/","page":"N-layer Cylinder","title":"N-layer Cylinder","text":"Whereas a complex term is added in the Frequency Domain:","category":"page"},{"location":"Nlayer_cyl/","page":"N-layer Cylinder","title":"N-layer Cylinder","text":"alpha_k = sqrts_n^2 + fracmu_a_kD + fraciomegaDc","category":"page"},{"location":"Nlayer_cyl/","page":"N-layer Cylinder","title":"N-layer Cylinder","text":"As you can notice the first term of G_1(s_n z) contains exponentially decaying functions which is great as you can see that alpha has to be summed for very large numbers.

It is much better to define (though messier) the Green's function in terms of exponetials using sinhx = (e^x - e^-x)2 and coshx = (e^x + e^-x)2.

So now we have expressed the Green's function in terms of exponentially decaying functions instead of dividing by exponentially growing functions so we are confident that we won't get overflow errors as alpha goes to infinity. We are now ready to discuss the last pesky thing which are the gamma_3 and beta_3 factors. These are generally obtained from recurrence relations in [1] by equation 17 and 18. As presented they also contain exponentially growing functions. Where before we only had sinhalpha_1 l_1 now we have exponential functions of all the layers. This is especially challenging if we consider the bottom layer to be large. In general the same procedure we used prior should be used but we can't explicitly write them in terms of decaying functions because these factors actually do exponentially increase. What we can do is take advantage of the way they present in G_1(s_n z) which is (beta_3 - gamma_3)(beta_3 + gamma_3). We need to find a common exponentially growing factor that presents in both coefficients that we can then cancel.","category":"page"},{"location":"Nlayer_cyl/","page":"N-layer Cylinder","title":"N-layer Cylinder","text":"After we factor a common term out we can then define the coefficients for an N-layered cylinder as :","category":"page"},{"location":"Nlayer_cyl/","page":"N-layer Cylinder","title":"N-layer Cylinder","text":"N = 2:","category":"page"},{"location":"Nlayer_cyl/","page":"N-layer Cylinder","title":"N-layer Cylinder","text":"beta_3 = 1 - e^-2 alpha_2 (l_2 + z_b_2) 5pt\ngamma_3 = 1 + e^-2 alpha_2 (l_2 + z_b_2)","category":"page"},{"location":"Nlayer_cyl/","page":"N-layer Cylinder","title":"N-layer Cylinder","text":"N = 3:","category":"page"},{"location":"Nlayer_cyl/","page":"N-layer Cylinder","title":"N-layer Cylinder","text":"beta_3 = D_2 alpha_2 n_2^2 (1 + e^-2alpha_2 l_2)(1 - e^-2 alpha_3 (l_3 + z_b_2)) + D_3 alpha_3 n_3^2 (1 - e^-2alpha_2 l_2)(1 + e^-2 alpha_3 (l_3 + z_b_2)) 5pt\ngamma_3 = D_2 alpha_2 n_2^2 (1 - e^-2alpha_2 l_2)(1 - e^-2 alpha_3 (l_3 + z_b_2)) + D_3 alpha_3 n_3^2 (1 + e^-2alpha_2 l_2)(1 + e^-2 alpha_3 (l_3 + z_b_2))","category":"page"},{"location":"Nlayer_cyl/","page":"N-layer Cylinder","title":"N-layer Cylinder","text":"N = 4:","category":"page"},{"location":"Nlayer_cyl/","page":"N-layer Cylinder","title":"N-layer Cylinder","text":"beta_4 = D_3 alpha_3 n_3^2 (1 + e^-2alpha_3 l_3) (1 - e^-2alpha_4 (l_4 + z_b_2) + D_4 alpha_4 n_4^2 (1 - e^-2alpha_3 l_3) (1 + e^-2alpha_4 (l_4 + z_b_2) 5pt\ngamma_4 = D_3 alpha_3 n_3^2 (1 - e^-2alpha_3 l_3) (1 - e^-2alpha_4 (l_4 + z_b_2) + D_4 alpha_4 n_4^2 (1 + e^-2alpha_3 l_3) (1 + e^-2alpha_4 (l_4 + z_b_2) ","category":"page"},{"location":"Nlayer_cyl/","page":"N-layer Cylinder","title":"N-layer Cylinder","text":"beta_3 = D_2 alpha_2 n_2^2 beta_4 (1 + e^-2alpha_2 l_2) + D_3 alpha_3 n_3^2 gamma_4 (1 - e^-2alpha_2 l_2) 5pt\ngamma_3 = D_2 alpha_2 n_2^2 beta_4 (1 - e^-2alpha_2 l_2) + D_3 alpha_3 n_3^2 gamma_4 (1 + e^-2alpha_2 l_2)","category":"page"},{"location":"Nlayer_cyl/","page":"N-layer Cylinder","title":"N-layer Cylinder","text":"N  4: Use start values","category":"page"},{"location":"Nlayer_cyl/","page":"N-layer Cylinder","title":"N-layer Cylinder","text":"beta_N = D_N-1 alpha_N-1 n_n-1^2 (1 + e^-2alpha_N-1l_N-1)(1 - e^-2alpha_N-1(l_N-1 + z_b_2)) 5pt\n + D_N alpha_N n_n^2 (1 - e^-2alpha_N-1l_N-1)(1 + e^-2alpha_N(l_N + z_b_2)) 10pt\ngamma_N = D_N-1 alpha_N-1 n_n-1^2 (1 - e^-2alpha_N-1l_N-1)(1 - e^-2alpha_N-1(l_N-1 + z_b_2)) 5pt\n + D_N alpha_N n_n^2 (1 + e^-2alpha_N-1l_N-1)(1 + e^-2alpha_N(l_N + z_b_2))","category":"page"},{"location":"Nlayer_cyl/","page":"N-layer Cylinder","title":"N-layer Cylinder","text":"With downward recurrence relations: ","category":"page"},{"location":"Nlayer_cyl/","page":"N-layer Cylinder","title":"N-layer Cylinder","text":"beta_k - 1 = D_k - 2 alpha_k - 2 n_k - 2^2 (1 + e^-2alpha_k - 2l_k - 2) beta_k + D_k - 1 alpha_k - 1 n_k - 1^2 (1 - e^-2alpha_k - 2l_k - 2) gamma_k 5pt\ngamma_k - 1 = D_k - 2 alpha_k - 2 n_k - 2^2 (1 - e^-2alpha_k - 2l_k - 2) beta_k + D_k - 1 alpha_k - 1 n_k - 1^2 (1 + e^-2alpha_k - 2l_k - 2) gamma_k","category":"page"},{"location":"Nlayer_cyl/","page":"N-layer Cylinder","title":"N-layer Cylinder","text":"[1]: Liemert, André, and Alwin Kienle. \"Light diffusion in a turbid cylinder.

The main motivation behind the development of this library is to provide an easy-to-use, open-source framework that highlights and standardizes prominent analytical techniques to model light transport in different geometries. The radiative transport equation (RTE) and its approximations to model propagation of particles in random media are frequently applied in astrophysics, nuclear physics, biophotonics, heat transfer, computer graphics, and climate research. This package focuses on their use in biomedical applications with a focus on performance and accuracy.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The library has two main components split into (a) the forward modelling of light transport and (b) the associated inverse problem.
